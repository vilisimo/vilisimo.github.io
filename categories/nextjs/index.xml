      <description>What? Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started playing with Next.js. I liked it so much I decided to rebuild my blog with it. It just so happens that I also was thinking about getting a new domain. The stars aligned and I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the blog to https://directedignorance.com. Come visit, perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll like it.
Why? Domain I&amp;rsquo;ve never really liked vilisimo.com. Nothing wrong with it, I just don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it all that much. &amp;ldquo;Directed ignorance&amp;rdquo;, on the other hand, reminds me of Discworld, one of my favorite book series.</description>
