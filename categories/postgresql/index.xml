      <description>Recently I’ve had the opportunity to give a short presentation at my work on PostgreSQL, and more specifically, concurrency control. While preparing for the presentation, I’ve come across a term that I was not familiar with: multiversion concurrency control (MVCC). I wish I could tell myself that this is an obscure area of research that I had no business of knowing anyway, but the fact is that it is a pretty well known concurrency control method.</description>
