      <description>What The current blog, built with Hugo.
It is actually a combination of two projects, one being the blog itself, and the other being the theme that the blog uses: emperor.
Why I had been wondering about statically generated websites for a while until one day I decided to have a go at it for an evening or two. A few months and three themes (two heavily customised and one built from scratch) later I can finally say I have a pretty firm grasp of how to cobble together a statically generated website with Hugo.</description>

      <title>Sink</title>

      <description>What Sink is a personal finance tracker that helps to track your expenses. It can be used to get a better overview of what exactly the money is being spent on. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s still in (slow) development and not it is not available in either of the app stores, so you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want something else for now.
Why I began coding it to get a grip on Flutter, at the time a new and shiny tool that was flying mostly under the radar.</description>

      <guid>https://vilisimo.com/projects/steamcli/</guid>
      <description>What steamCLI is a command line tool that allows searching for game prices on Steam straight from the command line. It supports recent and overall ratings, current prices (on Steam), historical low price, different currencies and regions.
The tool was written purely in Python 3.6 and leverages IsThereAnyDeal API. It can be installed via pip.
Why I wrote it mainly to mess with APIs and Python. Although I did have a genuine use case at the time that I came up with this idea, as I did not particuarly enjoy manually checking the prices.</description>

      <description>What cookme serves as a simple recipe holder with a no-nonsense frontend. You can visit it here:
https://cookmetoo.herokuapp.com/
It takes a while to load the first time, as it is on a free Heroku tier.
A user can browse recipes that have been added by the other users. Also, the user can search for ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use. If there are recipes containing them, the matching recipes will be shown.</description>

      <guid>https://vilisimo.com/projects/emperor/</guid>
      <description>What &amp;ldquo;Emeperor&amp;rdquo; is a theme for Hugo-based websites. It is primarily aimed at blogs and people who want to showcase their projects.
Why The main reason to create the theme was lack of themes that really caught my eye. Although Emperor may not be the prettiest theme, it is a theme that I, having created it, know inside out, and that is simple and easy to change. Hence, I have a full control of how it looks.</description>

      <description>What Every serious programmer secretly craves to program todo applications. tasks quenches this burning desire. It is a command line tool to enable creating and keeping track of tasks that need to be done.
Why The main reason for this project was to have a simple project that allowed some degree of experimentation with various Java-based technologies. In fact, it was the first project that I used Java 9 with (mm, Map.</description>

      <title>Tables</title>

      <guid>https://vilisimo.com/projects/tables/</guid>
      <description>What tables is a tool to build a table and print it to a terminal. It was extracted from tasks project, when printing a proper table proved to be more tricky than the actual project itself.
Why There was no intention to write anything related to the tables when I started dabbling with tasks. However, once I started thinking about how to approach printing multiline tables to a terminal it quickly became clear that a few newlines here and there would not suffice.</description>

      <guid>https://vilisimo.com/projects/books-crud/</guid>
      <description>What The project is a simple proof of concept CRUD app.
Why The main motivation for the app was to see what it feels like when half of the Spring&amp;rsquo;s magic is stripped away. And boy does the Spring project take care of a lot of things.</description>

      <description>These days, git is more or less synonymous with version control system. It does not matter what programming language you use, chances are you’ll use git to keep track of the code. Thus, one of the best ways to improve your development confidence and velocity is to get to know git well. While it is not necessary to understand all the minute details to be a proficient user, having a few neat tricks up your sleeve certainly helps.</description>

      <description>Few days ago I was playing with a Django application, trying to containerize it. Everything was going smoothly until I tried to run collectstatic in Dockerfile. Attempting to do so threw the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last): File &amp;#34;/home/project/app/manage.py&amp;#34;, line 33, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; main() File &amp;#34;/home/project/app/manage.py&amp;#34;, line 29, in main execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) File &amp;#34;/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py&amp;#34;, line 446, in execute_from_command_line utility.execute() File &amp;#34;/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py&amp;#34;, line 440, in execute self.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv) File &amp;#34;/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py&amp;#34;, line 402, in run_from_argv self.</description>

      <title>Setting Up pytest With GitHub Actions</title>

      <guid>https://vilisimo.com/blog/setting-up-pytest-with-github-actions/</guid>
      <description>For the longest time I have been ignoring GitHub Actions despite all the good things said about them. I’ve been a long-time user of CircleCI [1] - it is a solid CI/CD platform, and it is perfectly sufficient for my (minimal) needs. However, a few days ago I decided to give GitHub Actions a shot - having CI/CD steps defined on the same platform where the code resides seemed appealing.</description>

      <title>MVCC in PostgreSQL</title>

      <guid>https://vilisimo.com/blog/mvcc-in-postgresql/</guid>
      <description>Recently I’ve had the opportunity to give a short presentation at my work on PostgreSQL, and more specifically, concurrency control. While preparing for the presentation, I’ve come across a term that I was not familiar with: multiversion concurrency control (MVCC). I wish I could tell myself that this is an obscure area of research that I had no business of knowing anyway, but the fact is that it is a pretty well known concurrency control method.</description>

      <description>History History will be kind to me for I intend to write it. - Winston Churchill (not really)
As in real life, history in software development is important for several reasons. The first one is to have someone to blame when things go wrong. Once we&amp;rsquo;ve done that, it is also useful for figuring out how development has evolved, what changes were introduced, when they were introduced, and what was the reason for them.</description>
