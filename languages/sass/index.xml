      <description>What The current blog, built with Hugo.
It is actually a combination of two projects, one being the blog itself, and the other being the theme that the blog uses: emperor.
Why I had been wondering about statically generated websites for a while until one day I decided to have a go at it for an evening or two. A few months and three themes (two heavily customised and one built from scratch) later I can finally say I have a pretty firm grasp of how to cobble together a statically generated website with Hugo.</description>

      <description>What &amp;ldquo;Emeperor&amp;rdquo; is a theme for Hugo-based websites. It is primarily aimed at blogs and people who want to showcase their projects.
Why The main reason to create the theme was lack of themes that really caught my eye. Although Emperor may not be the prettiest theme, it is a theme that I, having created it, know inside out, and that is simple and easy to change. Hence, I have a full control of how it looks.</description>
