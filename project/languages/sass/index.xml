      <description>What The current blog, built with Hugo.
It is actually a combination of two projects, one being the blog itself, and the other being the theme that the blog uses: emperor.
Why I had been wondering about statically generated websites for a while until one day I decided to have a go at it for an evening or two. A few months and three themes (two heavily customised and one built from scratch) later I can finally say I have a pretty firm grasp of how to cobble together a statically generated website with Hugo.</description>
