      <description>https://cookmetoo.herokuapp.com/
cookme serves as a simple recipe holder with a no-nonsense frontend.
A user can browse recipes that have been added by other users. Additionally, the user can search for ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use. If there are recipes containing them, the matching recipes will be shown. Furthermore, the user can add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge. Once ingredients and recipes are added, the user can search the fridge for liked recipes that can be made with ingredients in the fridge.</description>

      <description>tasks is a simple command line tool to enable creating and keeping track of tasks that need to be done.
The main reason for this project was to have a simple project that allows some degree of experimentation with the following technologies a little bit more:
 HSQLDB JDBC Liquibase Log4j2 Maven Commons CLI  Apparently, coding CLI tools in Java is quite awkward. Who could have guessed.</description>

      <description>The project is a proof of concept CRUD app. Its main purpose was to have a place to play with:
 Dropwizard Groovy + Spock Camel Guice JDBI Docker  It mostly consists of wiring components and libraries to check how they work with one another. Hence, it really is a simple CRUD app.</description>
