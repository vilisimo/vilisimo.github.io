      <description>What Sink is a personal finance tracker that helps to track your expenses. It can be used to get a better overview of what exactly the money is being spent on. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s still in (slow) development and not it is not available in either of the app stores, so you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want something else for now.
Why I began coding it to get a grip on Flutter, at the time a new and shiny tool that was flying mostly under the radar.</description>
